## Product Vision

Self-organizing development teams have are in control of the way they go about their work.
They are able to connect their way of working
to the needs of the people with a stake in their work.
While going about their work, they reflect and improve: there must be a better way!

The when-will-it-be-done app will allow development teams to 
quickly experiment with different ways to go about their work.
These experiments will allow teams to assess the effects of new work policies
*before* they choose to apply them -
after minutes of coding and simulation.

This app allows development teams to 
see the impact of micro-, everyday decisions in terms of whole-playing-field outcomes.

It does it in a way that appeals to developers: 

 1. fork this repo
 1. modify the models to reflect your team's work policies
 1. run a simulation
 1. learn from the simulation's output

(Nothing here yet, deliberatley left blank.
Once we finish items from our product backlog, 
this specification will fill up.)

### Installation

### How to use

## Backlogs

### Doing

 [ ] Set up development environment (VS code, github, pipenv, simpy)

### Product Backlog

 [ ] Create a simple simulation with a development team performing analysis, development and test acitivities
 [ ] Explore ways to capture simulation output metrics
 [ ] Distill sample scenarios from [Vacanti2009]
 [ ] ...

## Background

The idea for this project emerged after watching the [When will it be done? Presentation by Daniel Vacanti].
In this presentation, he shares results of different work policies by simulating the policies 
using a proprietary simulation application. Let's verify these experiments using open source tools!

Daniel has written out his ideas in two books; one of which inspired the name of this application:
_When will it be done?_ [Vacanti2000]
