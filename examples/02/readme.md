This examples simulates a team with constrained capabilities.

The purpose of this simulation is to:

 * demonstrate the use of constrained resources
 * demonstrate a simple way to collect data on work items that you could apply in real life too
 * demonstrate how you could turn the collected data into meaningful charts
